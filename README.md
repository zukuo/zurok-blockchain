## About The Project

My final year university project that built a functional cryptocurrency blockchain network, that allows for P2P connections. All encompassed in a modern front-end wallet user interface.

The back-end responsible for handling the transactions and blocks within the blockchain, is written in Go. Whereas the front-end wallet utilises NextJS paired with TypeScript, of which both ends are connected together with the use of Wails.
